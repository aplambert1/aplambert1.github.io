    <p>I am in the class of 2025 at the University of Rhode Island, I will be a sophomore this coming fall. I am majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science. I am also a member of the URI women's ice hockey team. I love to play hockey and I am a goalie. I have been playing hockey since I was eight years old. Here is a picture of me playing hockey for URI.</p>

    <p>Some things I enjoy doing besides playing hockey are going to the beach, spending time with friends and family, working out, and reading books. I have a brother named Quinlan, a brother named Nolan, a sister named Campbell, and a dog named Piper. I am the oldest of my siblings. My family will be spending the summer in Laconia, New Hampshire where I will be working at an ice cream shop. Here is an image of Piper at the beach and some other pictures of me spending time with my family and friends.</p>
