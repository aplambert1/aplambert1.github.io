    <p>Hi, and welcome to my about me page! My name is Amelia Lambert.</p>

    <p>I am from Rumford, Rhode Island. I am in the class of 2025 at the University of Rhode Island, majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science. I am a goalie for the URI women's ice hockey team. I love to play hockey. Here is a picture of me playing hockey for URI.</p>

    <p>Some things I enjoy doing are going to the beach, spending time with friends and family, working out, and reading books. I have a brother named Quinlan, a brother named Nolan, a sister named Campbell, and a dog named Piper. I am the oldest of my siblings. Here is an image of Piper at the beach and some other pictures of me spending time with my family and friends.</p>
